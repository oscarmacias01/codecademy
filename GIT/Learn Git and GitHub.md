Git Workflow
1. <b><i>Working Directory</i></b>: where you do all of the work like creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
2. A <b><i>Staging Area</i></b>: where you'll list the changes you make tot he working directory
3. A <b><i>Repository</i></b>: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

4. When adding a commit message, think & reflect on how the project has changes since it began
